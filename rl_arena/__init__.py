RL Arena - A Python library for competitive reinforcement learning environments.

Quick Start:
    >>> import rl_arena
    >>>
    >>> # Create environment
    >>> env = rl_arena.make("pong")
    >>>
    >>> # Train agent (requires stable-baselines3)
    >>> model = rl_arena.train_dqn("pong", total_timesteps=10000)
    >>>
    >>> # Evaluate agent
    >>> agent = rl_arena.create_agent(model)
    >>> results = rl_arena.evaluate(agent, "pong", n_episodes=10)
    >>>
    >>> # Create submission
    >>> rl_arena.create_submission(agent, "my_agent.py", agent_name="MyAgent")
