## 📦 Installation

### From PyPI (recommended)

```bash
pip install rl-arena
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rl-arena/rl-arena-env.git
cd rl-arena-env
pip install -e .
```

### For Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rl-arena/rl-arena-env.git
cd rl-arena-env
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start (30 seconds!)

RL-Arena makes it easy to: **Create environments → Train agents → Test → Submit**

```python
import rl_arena

# 1️⃣ Create environment
env = rl_arena.make("pong")

# 2️⃣ Train agent (DQN)
model = rl_arena.train_dqn("pong", total_timesteps=10000)

# 3️⃣ Test agent
agent = rl_arena.create_agent(model)
results = rl_arena.evaluate(agent, "pong", n_episodes=10)
print(f"Average reward: {results['mean_reward']:.2f}")

# 4️⃣ Create submission file
rl_arena.create_submission(
    agent,
    "my_submission.py",
    agent_name="MyAgent",
    author="your_name"
)
```

**That's it!** Submit `my_submission.py` to rl-arena-backend.

## 📖 Basic Usage

### Environment Creation

```python
import rl_arena

# Create environment
env = rl_arena.make("pong")

# Use built-in agents
agent1 = rl_arena.RandomAgent()
agent2 = rl_arena.RuleBasedAgent()

# Run a game
observations, info = env.reset(seed=42)
done = False

while not done:
    # Get actions from agents
    actions = [
        agent1.act(observations[0]),
        agent2.act(observations[1])
    ]
    
    # Step environment
    observations, rewards, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(actions)
    done = terminated or truncated
    
    # Render
    env.render()

print(f"Final scores: {info['scores']}")
env.close()
```

## 🎯 Available Environments

| Environment | Players | Description | Complexity |
|-------------|---------|-------------|------------|
| **pong** | 2 | Classic Pong game | ⭐ Easy |

**More environments coming soon!** Contributions welcome! 

## 🎮 Environment Details

### Pong

Classic 2-player Pong game with customizable physics.

```python
env = rl_arena.make("pong", configuration={
    "winning_score": 11,    # First to 11 wins
    "max_steps": 1000,      # Episode length limit
    "ball_speed": 0.02,     # Ball movement speed
    "paddle_height": 0.2,   # Paddle size
})
```

**State Space:** Ball position & velocity, paddle positions, scores  
**Action Space:** Discrete(3) - UP, STAY, DOWN  
**Rewards:** +1 for scoring, -1 for conceding

See [Pong documentation](rl_arena/envs/pong/README.md) for more details.

## 📖 Examples

### Train and Evaluate Agent

```python
import rl_arena

# Train DQN agent
model = rl_arena.train_dqn("pong", total_timesteps=50000)

# Evaluate performance
agent = rl_arena.create_agent(model)
results = rl_arena.evaluate(agent, "pong", n_episodes=20)
print(f"Win rate: {results['mean_reward']:.2%}")
```

### Interactive Play (Human vs AI)

```python
# Requires pygame: pip install pygame
player = rl_arena.play("pong", fps=60)
player.play(
    player1_agent=None,  # Human player
    player2_agent=agent,  # Your trained AI
)
```

### Record and Replay Matches

```python
from rl_arena.utils.replay import save_replay, replay_to_html

# Record match
recorder = rl_arena.MatchRecorder()
env = rl_arena.make("pong")
env.set_recorder(recorder)

# ... play game ...

# Save replay
recording = recorder.get_recording()
save_replay(recording, "match.json")

# Generate HTML replay
html = replay_to_html(recording, "pong", "replay.html")
```

### Create Submission File

```python
# Create submission for competition
rl_arena.create_submission(
    agent=agent,
    output_path="submission.py",
    agent_name="MyPongMaster",
    author="your_name",
    description="DQN agent trained for 50K steps"
)

# Validate submission
result = rl_arena.validate("submission.py")
if result['valid']:
    print("✅ Ready to submit!")
```

## 🎓 Use Cases
